# Meeting 2

Notes of the meeting:
sockets, Iostat, trie trees used for databases, threads, coroutines, processes, asynchronous, matrix ijk algo, crypto focus on hash fn, serialization just one lib, cereal or msgpack, timers precision and time read
iteration, recursion: bfs dfs or find a other algo
Eg. Implement f: x -> f(x-1)
Can also do with matrices
We need to work on strings
For next time: write spec of the project with system environment, program we want to write, metrics and everything

We can write our programs or look for already made benchmarks
We need to be comprehensive


Talk about memory safety features without forgetting it is for a high perf lab

# Meeting 3

We wrote part of this doc.

For next week:
- [ ] finish this doc
- [x] merge points 3 and 5
- [x] swap 4 and 6
- [ ] implement 1 & 2
- [ ] implement 7 Iteration vs recursion
- [ ] do as much as 3 Data structures and 5 Sorting as possible
- [ ] look what we need for 6 Matrix
